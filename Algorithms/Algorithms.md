## Recursion

Recursion, while not an algorithm itself, is a fundamental concept utilized in algorithm design.

**Recursion** involves a function calling itself within its definition.

It proves particularly effective for tasks featuring repeated subtasks.

Recursion is ubiquitous, appearing in various contexts such as:

- **DOM Traversal:** Navigating through the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page often involves recursive operations.
  
- **Nested Objects:** In JavaScript, recursion is evident when dealing with objects containing nested objects.

Every recursive function must include a **base case** to halt the recursion. Failing to establish a base case can lead to the Stack Overflow Problem.

In recursion, both the base case and the recursive case must return values. The base case signals termination, while the recursive case propagates the desired result.

Recursion offers a powerful tool for solving problems with repetitive structures, providing elegant and concise solutions.
