## Problem Statement

Given two arrays, create a function that determines whether these two arrays contain any common items. For example:

```python
array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x']
array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i']
# should return False

array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x']
array2 = ['z', 'y', 'x']
# should return True
```

## Inputs & Outputs

**Input**: Two arrays of unknown size, containing elements of type `char`.
**Output**: Boolean (True or False).

## Problem Clarifications

- Is time complexity or space complexity more important?
- Do we know the size of the arrays? Will they be large or fixed?

## Naive Approach

A simple approach would be to use nested loops to compare each element of the first array with each element of the second array.

```python
def containCommonElement(arr_1, arr_2):
    for elem_arr_1 in arr_1:
        for elem_arr_2 in arr_2:
            if elem_arr_1 == elem_arr_2:
                return True
    return False
```

This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays, respectively.

## Why This Approach Is Not the Best

The naive approach has a quadratic time complexity, which could be inefficient for large arrays.

## Optimized Approach

We can improve the time complexity by converting one of the arrays into a set or a dictionary, allowing constant-time lookup.

```python
def containCommonElement2(arr_1, arr_2):
    map = {}
    for elem in arr_1: 
        if elem not in map:
            map[elem] = True
    
    for elem in arr_2:
        if elem in map: 
            return True
    return False
```

This approach has a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the first array.

## Error Handling

- Check if both arrays contain elements of type `char`.
- Handle cases where one or both arrays are empty.

## Code Readability

Improve code readability by using meaningful variable names and clear comments.

## Testing

Test the code with various inputs, including edge cases such as empty arrays, arrays of different sizes, and arrays with overlapping elements.

## Possible Improvements

Depending on the programming language, there may be built-in methods or libraries that offer more efficient solutions to this problem. Consider researching alternative approaches to further optimize the code.

## Final Remarks

The final version of the code has significantly improved time complexity but requires more memory compared to the naive approach. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the environment, the choice between time and space efficiency may vary.
